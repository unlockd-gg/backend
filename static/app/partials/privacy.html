      <h2 id="how-we-use-information">How we use information we collect</h2>
          <p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li><b>To provide the Services and personalize your experience:</b> We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in,
              provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services.
              For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users.  </li>

            <li><b>For research and development:</b> We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated and useful to you.
              We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage,
              activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.
              For example, we used information collected about how users engaged with new games to design a better, more user-friendly game on-borading experience.
              In some cases, we apply these learnings to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use.
              We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users. </li>

            <li><b>To communicate with you about the Services:</b> We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services,
              including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support,
              and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.

            <li><b>To market, promote, and drive engagement with the Services:</b> We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you,
              including by email and by displaying UETOPIA ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google.
              These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.
              We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."</li>

            <li><b>Customer support:</b> We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.

            <li><b>For safety and security:</b> We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies. </li>

            <li><b>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:</b>
              Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others,
              we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business. </li>

            <li><b>With your consent:</b> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.
              For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission. </li>

            <li><b>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):</b>
              If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.
              The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>

              <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 40px; margin-bottom:40px;">
                <li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services; </li>
                <li> It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; </li>
                <li> You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or </li>
                <li> We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation. </li>
              </ul>

            <p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
              Where we are using your information because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.</p> </li>
            </ul>





            <h2 id="how-we-share">How we share information we collect</h2>
                  <p>We make multiplayer game development tools, and we want them to work well for you.

                    We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,
                    but we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties. </p>

                      For example, when you join a game, we display your profile picture and name in the recent players list so that other users with access to the game can see new activity.
                      Similarly, when you join a team, your name, profile picture and contact information and will be displayed in a list for other team members so they can find and interact with you.
                      Please be aware that some games can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted on that game, including information about you, can be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in
                      search results of search engines.

                    <li><b>Game Developers:</b> Developers and game studios use our Service in order to provide multiplayer features for their players.

                    <li><b>Links to Third-Party Sites:</b> The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours.
                      Your use of and any information you submit to any of those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. </li>

                    <li><b>Third-Party Widgets:</b> Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button.
                      These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
                      Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.

                      In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation,
                      legal process or governmental request,
                      including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services,

                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="how-we-store">How we store and secure information we collect</h2>

                    <h3>Information storage and security</h3>

                    <p>We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.
                      While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,
                      we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
                      We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe. </p>

                    <h3>How long we keep information</h3>

                    <p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or,
                      if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. </p>
                      <ul style="list-style-type: none">
                        <li><b>Account information:</b> We retain your account information until you delete your account. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes,
                          to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development,
                          we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</li>
                        <li><b>Information you share on the Services:</b> If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow
                          other users to make full use of the Services.
                          For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to games. </li>
                        <li><b>Marketing information:</b> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information.
                          We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created. </li>
                      </ul>




                      <h2 id="how-to-access">How to access and control your information</h2>
                      <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
                        <h3>Your Choices:</h3>
                        <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.
                          Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.
                          You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see "Notice to End Users" below),
                          you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.</p>
                          <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
                            Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by playing a game, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.
                            If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>

                                  Please be aware that deactivating access to a group, team or game does not delete your information from that group, team or game; your information remains visible to other Service users
                                  based on your past participation within the Services.

                                  Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations. </li>
                                <li><b>Request that we stop using your information:</b> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.
                                  For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.
                                  Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.
                                  You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.
                                  When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.
                                  If there is a delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).
                                  If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party game, please disable the game or contact your administrator to do so.</li>
                                <li> <b>Opt out of communications:</b> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email,
                                  updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu,
                                  or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.
                                  Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.
                                  You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.

                                <li><b>Send "Do Not Track" Signals:</b> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.
                                Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
                                You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.</li>
                                <li><b>Data portability:</b> Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).
                                Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it,
                                we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control, like your own games. </li>

                                      If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies.
